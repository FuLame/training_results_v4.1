  0: The number of process groups to use SHARP with depends on the type of the network switch. Nvidia QM1 switch supports SAHRP up to 8 process groups and QM2 supports up to 256 process groups. We apply SHARP to the communications of the data-parallel domain. If the number of data-parallel process groups is larger than the max process groups that the network switch supports, the communication will fall back to non-SHARP operators. To enable SHARP, `#SBATCH_NETWORK=sharp` should be set in the sbatch script.
